1. Deploy backend and database without docker - create JAR
  - in /src/main/java/hello/Application.java, switch over the CORS from the development comment to the production comment
  - in /SpringBootRestAPI/ execute $mvn clean package
  - new .jar will be at /SpringBootRestAPI/target/
  - deploy to amazon elastic beanstalk using a mysql server, get the mysql login info from application.properties
  - https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home?region=us-east-2#/environment/dashboard?applicationName=sojoin-api&environmentId=e-mmkexshvpf

2. Deploy frontend separately - using an s3 bucket - very cheap and used to serve static content
  - in /ReactFrontend/src/APIRequest.js, change comment from development to production
  - in /ReactFrontend/ run $npm run build
  - upload the contents of the build folder to s3 instance
  - there is a way to automatically do this with aws CLI and package.json / npm run deploy
  - react domain: http://sojoin-react.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/

- https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service-cors/ can have global setting for CORS to accept it from whatever page the frontend is at

find a domain name, should resolve connection insecurity
